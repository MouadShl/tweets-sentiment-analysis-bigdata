o1wn69h,"1. The Shootdown Details Pakistan did shoot down Indian jets during this conflict. Pakistan's Claim: On May 7, 2025, after India launched airstrikes (Operation Sindoor), Pakistan claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets in retaliation. India's Confirmation: Unlike in 2019 (where they denied most losses), India eventually acknowledged taking hits. In June 2025, India's Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Anil Chauhan, confirmed that India had lost aircraft during the May battles. The Jets Involved: Reports indicated India lost at least one Rafale and one Mirage 2000 during the heavy dogfights. This was a huge deal because it was the first combat loss of a Rafale. 2. How it Started (The Timeline) The Trigger: It started with a terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, Kashmir, in April 2025. The Strike: India launched ""Operation Sindoor"" on May 7, 2025, targeting militant camps in Pakistan. The Escalation: This led to massive aerial skirmishes between May 7 and May 10. It was much more intense than 2019, involving hundreds of aircraft and drone swarms. 3. Why it was so confusing (The ""Fake News"" War) You might remember it being chaotic because the disinformation was out of control. Deepfakes: This was the first major conflict where AI deepfakes were used extensively. There were fake videos of the Indian PM surrendering and fake videos of Pakistani generals being captured. Video Game Footage: Both sides flooded social media with clips from video games (like Arma 3) claiming it was real combat footage, which made it nearly impossible for regular people to know what was actually happening. So, your memory is correct: India took significant losses in the air in 2025, and they eventually admitted it, even though they initially tried to keep it quiet.",neg

It just replaces their clothed body with an unclothed facsimile. It's roughly the equivalent to cutting out a body from a pornographic magazine and taping it on top of a photo of someone you want to imagine naked, but Grok does the extra legwork of going through thousands of magazines to find a body that looks like the head you're taping it to and then publishes that mock-up to a public forum.
