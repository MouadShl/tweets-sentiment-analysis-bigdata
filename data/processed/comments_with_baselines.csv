Here's what I found: https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/what-happens-to-crew-members-aboard-oil-tankers-with-venezuela-ties/ar-AA1TPvip

&gt; #Crew members will likely be entangled in US-Russia showdown
&gt;
&gt;While the U.S. has claimed jurisdiction over the tankers, whether the vessels are truly stateless remains unclear, Martin J. Davies, a professor of maritime law at Tulane University, said. He added Russia will likely contest the seizure of the tanker with its flag.  
&gt;
&gt; Those crew members will be caught in the middle of a ÔÇ£geopolitical face-offÔÇØ between Russia and the United States, he said.
&gt;
&gt; They are ÔÇ£invisible victimsÔÇØ in the sense that the legality of their detention will be argued far above their role, in cases involving profound questions of international law, Davies said.
&gt;
&gt; U.S. sanctions target those arranging the oil trade, not the sailors themselves, Davies said, adding that the ÔÇ£legal provision here is not at all clear.ÔÇØ
&gt;
&gt; Since they have been claimed by the U.S., they will be subject to U.S. laws, but if charged, the ÔÇ£legal basis for prosecuting the crew members is tenuous at best,ÔÇØ Davies noted.

So far, my understanding is that the crew were detained but not charged due to the ambiguities in the law. Essentially, the US is waiting for Russia to make an offer, to trade something for the detainees... I.e. the US doesn't want to deal with them / doesn't want to put them in prison as they care about the ship and the cargo, not the crew. Also, knowing how Russia treats its people, especially knowing that the crew were some non-Russian sailors... I don't expect Russia to trade much of anything for them. So, my guess is that after a few months in detention the crew will be sent to whatever country they have a passport of and that will be the end of the story.",-0.8035,neg,0.020312500000000008,neu

&gt;The former world order has no moral high ground currency to claim, so China's political capitol losses will be tiny, so now Winnie the Pooh can say ""Eh... fuck it"" and do whatever he wants.

The Xi era of China has seen the decline of China's economic rise, a disastrous COVID pandemic response, further decline into even worse authoritarianism and a massive crash of the real-estate market. Xi realizes that he will be remembered terribly if he doesn't accomplish something, and views Taiwan as a solution to this. The problem is that no matter what, invading Taiwan will ensure countless losses of equipment and manpower for China even if Taiwan gets no support. It's going to be an amphibious invasion that is more ambitious than D-day. 

I don't see how the political capital loss will not be immensely high even if China fully captures Taiwan. It is just going to be extremely difficult and the only thing that China will net is a nationalist/irrendist ideological victory (best case scenario). Realistically, the economic losses, global crash and political isolation will be severe stressed on the CCP, it is just that Xi has locked the party down a slow death where taking Taiwan is likely existential to the party's survival, but once they try to take Taiwan, failure becomes existential to the CCP",-0.9712,neg,-0.03800766283524904,neu

1. The Confirmed Shootdown (MiG-21)
ÔÇïWhat happened: An Indian Air Force MiG-21 Bison was shot down by a Pakistani jet (likely an F-16 or JF-17) after it crossed the Line of Control to intercept Pakistani aircraft.
ÔÇïThe Pilot: The Indian pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected safely but landed in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. He was captured by the Pakistani military, beaten by a local mob, rescued by Pakistani soldiers, and interrogated.  
ÔÇïOutcome: He became the face of the conflict. Pakistan released him two days later as a ""peace gesture"" to de-escalate tensions.  
ÔÇï2. The Disputed Claims (The ""Other"" Jets)
ÔÇïBoth sides made claims about other aircraft that were never fully proven to the public.
ÔÇïIndia's Claim: India claims that before he was shot down, Abhinandan locked onto and shot down a Pakistani F-16. Pakistan denies this, stating they did not lose any aircraft. The US later did a count of Pakistan's F-16 fleet; some reports said all were accounted for, while Indian sources disputed the thoroughness of that count.  
ÔÇïPakistan's Claim: Pakistan initially claimed they shot down two Indian jets (the MiG-21 and a Su-30MKI). However, they only produced wreckage and a pilot from the MiG-21. India denied losing a Su-30, and no wreckage of a second Indian jet was ever found.  
ÔÇï3. The Friendly Fire Incident (The Helicopter)
ÔÇïIn the chaos of that same morning, a tragic mistake occurred on the Indian side. An Indian Mi-17 helicopter crashed in Budgam, killing 6 Indian Air Force personnel and 1 civilian.  
ÔÇïIt was later confirmed that Indian air defense (a Spyder missile system) mistook their own helicopter for an incoming Pakistani missile or drone and shot it down. This was not done by Pakistan, but it was a direct result of the ""fog of war"" during the skirmish.  
ÔÇïSummary:
ÔÇïPakistan shot down: 1 Indian MiG-21 (Confirmed).  
ÔÇïIndia shot down: 1 Pakistani F-16 (Claimed by India, denied by Pakistan/US reports).  
ÔÇïIndia shot down (accidentally): 1 of its own Mi-17 helicopters.",-0.9943,neg,0.04197048611111111,neu

After the US Civil War, far too many traitorous, genocidal shit stains were essentially forgiven in the name of reconciliation, because the country was tired of war. And guess what happened?

It's Europe's own leaders saying it. Why do they continue to placate someone like Trump and embarrass themselves if they can just tell him to fuck off? It's because Europe is riddled with paralysis and unable to make any independent decisions. Eastern Europeans have zero trust or faith in Western Europeans to be able to hold off Russia. The largest and wealthiest country in Europe's Bundeswehr can't even field a single battalion to protect a forest and there's only a handful of European armies that are even worth talking about like the Fins and Poles. If you are so confident Europeans can hand Russia an ass kicking then go and do it. It will solve the Ukraine issue overnight and you will no longer ever have to even play pretend at trying to please Trump and it would free you from the indignation of having to appease an idiot like Trump.,0.9675,pos,0.09489795918367347,pos

Even if that course runs into an iceburg.  Even if that course runs into a mountain.  Even if that course means they dump a 30 point lead and ALMOST give their opponents a majority government... they CANNOT change course.

And, for whatever reason, they set up PP as their captain, so they are ride-or-die with him, no matter how bad an idea it proves to be.

And, PP really has only 2 tricks - 1) attack Trudeau, and 2) his shitty 3 word verb-the-noun slogans.  When the libs replaced Trudeau with Carney, that, alone, brought the odds of a liberal government to about even.  When Carney dumped the consumer carbon tax, it stole PP's second trick right out from under him (""Axe The Tax"").  He couldn't pivot, because, being a conservative, his only play is to STAY THE COURSE, even if it leads to a defeat that NOBODY saw coming.

And he's proven, so far, that he STILL can't pivot.  Every single smarmy word out of his mouth is DRIPPING in disdain, and I have yet to hear him come up with ANY positive policy position.

The cons have tried to strike a more conciliatory tone in the past week or so, but I remain skeptical - if they actually try to work with the liberals, instead of against ALL OF CANADA's best interests, then wonderful - but until they SHOW that they are working with us, as far as I'm concerned, they are continuing to work AGAINST us, and the interests of all canadians.

* \[He's\] sharply criticizing what he called a ÔÇ£federal retribution on the citizens of our stateÔÇØ
* ÔÇ£I cannot support the ÔÇª stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.ÔÇØ
* But he said Operation Metro Surge had ÔÇ£expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threatsÔÇØ. ÔÇ£United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear,ÔÇØ Madel said,
* ÔÇ£United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. ThatÔÇÖs wrong.ÔÇØ
* As Madel put it, he said he had spoken with US citizens detained by ICE in Minnesota ÔÇ£due to the color of their skinÔÇØ, including law enforcement officers stopped during what he described as pretextual encounters. ÔÇ£Driving while Hispanic is not a crime,ÔÇØ he said, two days after federal agents fatally shot Pretti even though video showed him restrained and not holding a weapon. ÔÇ£Neither is driving while Asian.ÔÇØ

This is a pretty big deal because just a couple weeks ago, ""Madel had launched his gubernatorial bid in December and┬áprovided┬álegal counsel to the ICE agent Jonathan Ross after he shot Good to death on 7 January while she drove away from an encounter with him.""

All of this is in the article. Madel is not a bastion of morality, in my opinion. However, he ended up in the weeds of the issue and was so appalled that he bailed despite being a bad dude. He definitely has disdain for immigrants and probably sees them as subhuman, but even he openly recognizes how morally unconscionable the current actions are. People like him peeling away from Trump is what needs to happen if we are going to see something real change.

My original point is that treating all 70,000 deaths as morally identical victims is misleading because that number includes both civilians and combatants.

Accepting that assumption without question is what makes the beating up coworkers analogy break down. It assumes everyone in the group is innocent and uninvolved, which isnÔÇÖt the case here. Some people killed were actively participating in the conflict, others were used as cover, and most were uninvolved bystanders.

ThatÔÇÖs why the analogy is a gross oversimplification. Looking at high civilian casualties without considering context doesnÔÇÖt capture the complexity of the situation. This is a territory governed by an armed group that carried out a mass attack against a neighboring country, took hostages, and fights from within civilian infrastructure. Critically engaging with these factors doesn't make civilian deaths acceptable, it just shows you canÔÇÖt treat all 70,000 deaths as morally identical.

To expand the analogy, the goal is to get the person who stole the pen except the pen is something far more serious and the person who took it is effectively running the place. The thief is not a random employee. HeÔÇÖs the director, some employees actively help him hide the pen, and he deliberately puts other employees in harmÔÇÖs way.

It's roughly the equivalent to cutting out a body from a pornographic magazine and taping it on top of a photo of someone you want to imagine naked, but Grok does the extra legwork of going through thousands of magazines to find a body that looks like the head you're taping it to and then publishes that mock-up to a public forum.

ÔÇ£I fear for my life, I fear I wonÔÇÖt get out of this,ÔÇØ says the 49-year-old in the video obtained by his family and broadcast by ArgentinaÔÇÖs TN television news channel.

The footage was reportedly recorded shortly after GiulianiÔÇÖs arrest in May 2025, though it was only released to the media on Saturday. 

Giuliani was in Venezuela for work when he was detained between May 21 and May 23 on alleged charges of drug-trafficking and terrorism.

Since then he has been held at various detention centres in Venezuela. According to communications with the family, he is now being held at the Yare II maximum-security prison in the state of Miranda.

The video was recorded on a mobile phone at a detention facility in Caracas ÔÇ£in June 2025,ÔÇØ said GiulianiÔÇÖs wife, Virginia Rivero.

ÔÇ£IÔÇÖm here locked up somewhere in Venezuela and have been for more than a week now. TheyÔÇÖve kept me incommunicado for a week. They havenÔÇÖt told me anything,ÔÇØ the lawyer said at the start of his message.

In his video, Giuliani said that ÔÇ£no citizen in the world deservesÔÇØ what was happening to him at present.

ÔÇ£Here I feel I have no rights at all and that theyÔÇÖre doing whatever they want, or whatever they feel like, with me,ÔÇØ he said.

Rivero said that she received the video ÔÇ£about 10 days agoÔÇØ from an anonymous Instagram user, who later deleted the account.

ÔÇ£WeÔÇÖve only just decided to share it now. We think this helps protect Germ├ín,ÔÇØ the detaineeÔÇÖs wife added.

Rivero has been hoping to be reunited with her husband since January 3, when VenezuelaÔÇÖs deposed president Nicol├ís Maduro and his wife were captured and taken to New York in a US military operation in Caracas.

On January 8, the government of interim leader Delcy Rodr├¡guez promised the release of ÔÇ£numerous prisoners.ÔÇØ

However, since then only around 150 people out of more than 800 detained for political reasons have been freed, according to an assessment by various NGOs.

Giuliani is not the only Argentinian being held by Venezuela. Another prominent case is Gendarmerie Corporal Nahuel Agust├¡n Gallo, who was arrested on December 8, 2024 as he entered Venezuela via a land border with Colombia to meet his partner and his son.",-0.9605,neg,0.07424242424242425,pos

ÔÇïPakistan did shoot down Indian jets during this conflict.
ÔÇïPakistan's Claim: On May 7, 2025, after India launched airstrikes (Operation Sindoor), Pakistan claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets in retaliation.
ÔÇïIndia's Confirmation: Unlike in 2019 (where they denied most losses), India eventually acknowledged taking hits. In June 2025, India's Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Anil Chauhan, confirmed that India had lost aircraft during the May battles.
ÔÇïThe Jets Involved: Reports indicated India lost at least one Rafale and one Mirage 2000 during the heavy dogfights. This was a huge deal because it was the first combat loss of a Rafale.
ÔÇï2. How it Started (The Timeline)
ÔÇïThe Trigger: It started with a terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, Kashmir, in April 2025.
ÔÇïThe Strike: India launched ""Operation Sindoor"" on May 7, 2025, targeting militant camps in Pakistan.
ÔÇïThe Escalation: This led to massive aerial skirmishes between May 7 and May 10. It was much more intense than 2019, involving hundreds of aircraft and drone swarms.
ÔÇï3. Why it was so confusing (The ""Fake News"" War)
ÔÇïYou might remember it being chaotic because the disinformation was out of control.
ÔÇïDeepfakes: This was the first major conflict where AI deepfakes were used extensively. There were fake videos of the Indian PM surrendering and fake videos of Pakistani generals being captured.
ÔÇïVideo Game Footage: Both sides flooded social media with clips from video games (like Arma 3) claiming it was real combat footage, which made it nearly impossible for regular people to know what was actually happening.
ÔÇïSo, your memory is correct: India took significant losses in the air in 2025, and they eventually admitted it, even though they initially tried to keep it quiet.",-0.9918,neg,-0.01877572016460905,neu
