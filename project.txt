Person 1 — Data Ingestion + Orchestration (Kafka / Airflow)

Goal: “Data enters the system continuously”

Reddit collector (PRAW streaming) → produces messages

Kafka topics (e.g., reddit_comments, reddit_posts, reddit_edges)

Airflow DAG to start/monitor collectors + streaming jobs (simple DAG is enough) 

document(4)


Outputs to share with team:

Kafka message schema (JSON)

A short README: how to run collector + Kafka

Person 2 — Streaming ETL + Storage (Spark Structured Streaming + MongoDB)

Goal: “Data is cleaned and stored + rolling metrics”

Spark Streaming from Kafka → parse JSON → clean text → enrich columns

Write to MongoDB collections (raw + processed + aggregates) 


Compute rolling aggregates per window (ex: 5 min): volume, top subreddits, top authors, avg score, etc.
Outputs to share:

MongoDB schema/collections

Sample queries + indexes

Person 3 — NLP / ML (Topic Modeling + Sentiment Model Training)

Goal: “Working NLP results + evaluation”

Topic modeling: baseline LDA or BERTopic (choose what you can run fast)

Sentiment:

Train your own model (fast option: TF‑IDF + Logistic Regression / Linear SVM)

Compare with VADER/TextBlob as baseline 

Provide metrics (accuracy/F1) + confusion matrix + example predictions
Outputs to share:

A model/ folder with saved model (joblib/pickle)

Inference function that Spark/Dashboard can call

Short “Model Card” (data, labels, metrics, limits)

time trends, engagement metrics, sentiment distribution

dominant topics

network graph visualization (static snapshot + refresh) 

Own the final slide deck structure + visuals

Outputs to share:

dashboard/ runnable app

network figures + screenshots for report/slides
